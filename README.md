  # Tips for creating topic lists
  
  - Students who will attend trainig have different knowledge level in web development. Therefore, while we are creating our topic lists and class activities, we should be careful in case there can be students who will finish class activities early.
  - While creating class activities, we shuould create 1 or 2 extra activities or 1 or 2 harder activities.
  - Please consider your training hour and topic scopes. Will all your topics be able to covered during training or not?
 

Good Luck :)
